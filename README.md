# METStudy2016
This repo contains all the code to do the MET study in 2016. To run, change funcs.sh with

```bash
MET_STUDY_HISTO_DIR=/PATH/TO/HISTOGRAMS/
MET_STUDY_PLOTS_OUTPUT_DIR=/PATH/TO/STORE/IMAGES/
```

then run `. funcs.sh` and `makeHistograms && makePlots`. This repo does not contain the code to make the babies, that is in the CMSTAS repo [ZMET2016](https://github.com/cmstas/ZMET2016).
